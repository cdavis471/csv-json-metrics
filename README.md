# CSV JSON Metrics
This is a web application that is used to view the output of CSV and certain JSON files within a table. The initial design
was done as a personal side project while working at Mastercard as an Intern. It is not yet completed but in the current
state, all CSV files are viewable with only a certain JSON format at the minute confirmed working, examples of which I
will leave below.

### CSV File Format

```
title1,title2,title3,title4
data1,data2,data3,data4
data5,data6,data7,data8
`````

### JSON File Format

```
[
 {
   "title1": "data1",
   "title2": "data2",
   "title3": "data3",
   "title4": "data4"
 },
 {
   "title1": "data5",
   "title2": "data6",
   "title3": "data7",
   "title4": "data8"
 }
]
```
